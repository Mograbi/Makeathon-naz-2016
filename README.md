# Makeathon-naz-2016
My Project in Makeathon Nazareth in 2016, tool that fit on sunglasses while driving that prevents you from sleeping while driving

we used Genuino 101 with built in gyro that detects the head movement while driving
in case of looking down for a while then supposedly you slept while driving then we send sound signal using passive buzzer until you will get up
